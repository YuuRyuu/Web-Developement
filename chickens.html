        The
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"><b>chicken</b></a>
        (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated
        from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most
        chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept
        as pets or for cockfighting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
        population of 26.5 billion as of 2023, and an annual production of more
        than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs
        per year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in
        folklore, religion, and literature.

      <h2>Nomenclature</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Biddy: a chicken, or a newly hatched chicken</li>
        <li>Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken</li>
        <li>Chick: a young chicken</li>
        <li>Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)</li>
        <li>Cock: a fertile adult male chicken</li>
        <li>Cockerel: a young male chicken</li>
        <li>Hen: an adult female chicken</li>
        <li>
          Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old. In the poultry
          industry, a pullet is a sexually immature chicken less than 22 weeks
          of age.

        Chicken can mean a chick, as in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth,
        where Macduff laments the death of "all my pretty chickens and their
        dam". The usage is preserved in placenames such as the Hen and Chicken
        Islands. In older sources, and still often in trade and scientific
        contexts, chickens as a species are described as common fowl or domestic
        fowl.

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round,
        the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short. Wild
        junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to
        allow them to fly more than a short distance. Size and coloration vary
        widely between breeds. Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest
        on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on
        either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more
        prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra
        feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard

      <h2>Origin</h2>
      <h3>Phylogeny</h3>
      <p>
        Water or ground-dwelling fowl similar to modern partridges, in the
        Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens belong to, survived the
        Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling
        birds and their dinosaur relatives.[43] Chickens are descended primarily
        from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and are scientifically
        classified as the same species.[44] Domesticated chickens freely
        interbreed with populations of red junglefowl.[44] The domestic chicken
        has subsequently hybridised with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl
        and green junglefowl;[45] a gene for yellow skin, for instance, was
        incorporated into domestic birds from the grey junglefowl (G.
        sonneratii).[46] It is estimated that chickens share between 71 and 79%
        of their genome with red junglefowl.[45]

      <h3>Domestication</h3>
      <p>
        According to one early study, a single domestication event of the red
        junglefowl in present-day Thailand gave rise to the modern chicken with
        minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[49] The red junglefowl
        is well adapted to take advantage of the vast quantities of seed
        produced during the end of the multi-decade bamboo seeding cycle, to
        boost its own reproduction.[50] In domesticating the chicken, humans
        took advantage of the red junglefowl's ability to reproduce prolifically
        when exposed to a surge in its food supply.[51]
